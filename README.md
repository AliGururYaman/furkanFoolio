Duplication of  old windows operating system.I basically wanted to crate  something reminds of  old windows xp  and wanted to play araound libarries. It was  a bit harder than I thought and I couldnt  really  finish the project the way I wanted but It was really fun and I learned a lot. Feel free to  try it out.
